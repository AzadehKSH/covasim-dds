# covasim-dds
Student project about the agent-based Covasim model to get into data driven simulation.

The department of computer science at the university of Rostock has a great course about data driven simulation.
During the course the students had to achieve milestones. The tasks for the milestones are given in `Project_Tasks.pdf`. 

This repository stores the Python code for three of the tasks:

1. Possible scenarios of Covid dynamics with different interventions
2. Sensitivity Analysis of four Covasim input parameters
3. Calibration of the Covasim model to data from Germany

Each folder consists of the final report and source code.
